## Usage
To run the script, simply execute the Python file in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python main.py
```
The bot will automatically start clicking the cookie on the Cookie Clicker webpage, purchase upgrades every 5 seconds, and stop after 5 minutes. The number of cookies per second (CPS) will be displayed at the end of the execution.
## How It Works
1. **Cookie Clicking**: The script clicks the cookie continuously to accumulate cookies.
2. **Upgrade Checking**: Every 5 seconds, the bot checks for available upgrades and compares the prices to the current cookie count.
3. **Upgrade Purchasing**: The bot will purchase the most expensive upgrade that it can afford.
4. **Stopping After 5 Minutes**: After 5 minutes, the script will stop and output the cookies per second (CPS) count.
5. **Error Handling**: The script includes retries in case of errors or connection issues.

## Flow of Execution:
1. **Start Cookie Clicking**: The bot clicks the cookie
2. **Check Upgrades**: Every 5 seconds, the bot checks the store for any upgrades.
3. **Purchase Upgrade**: If it has enough cookies, it buys the most expensive upgrade.
4. **Repeat**: This process continues for 5 minutes.
5. **Stop**: After 5 minutes, the bot stops, and the cookies per second count is displayed.
